    "The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency used to describe \n",

    "depending on the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean:\n",
    "The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by adding up all the values in a\n",

    "and help to understand the overall pattern and variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated by subtracting the \n",
    "minimum value from the maximum value in a dataset. It gives an idea of the total spread from\n",
    "the lowest to the highest value.\n",

    "- **Covariance:** The range of covariance is unrestricted, meaning it can take any value from negative\n",
